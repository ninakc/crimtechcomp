## A List of Tips and Notes 

1. Please do not rename any files, and follow the naming conventions we give you. Our (painstakingly built) tests rely on these to find your stuff, and if you rename "assignment.py" "duckduck.goose," you will fail all of our tests. ALL. OF. THEM. Do not ask us for help if you renamed our files and are surprised when your tests fail. We will roll our eyes at you (We're only partially kidding, don't do it). 

2. Always check capitalization, spelling, and punctuation (is this English class?)! It sounds silly, but they're responsible for so many hours of miserable debugging that it's a worthwhile habit to get into. We won't roll our eyes here, but we'll have a good laugh together about the silliness of the bug that caused you a half an hour (or more) of irritation. 

3. Python cares a lot about spaces ('\s') and tabs ('\t'), so be careful of which you're using (be consistent), and be ready to accidentally trigger code where you didn't intend by forgetting to indent. Can also be the cause of the dreaded "inconsistent use of tabs and spaces" error (fix by being consistent and patient).

4. Do not change our function/class/method definitions unless we explicitly say you can. This can mess with our tests and cause working code to fail. It's not fun. Bad time. 0/10. Don't do it (unless we say it's ok!)
