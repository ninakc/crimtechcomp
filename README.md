## Welcome!

Welcome to the Crimson Comp - 2018! We're looking forward to working together with you
to make this a wonderful experience for all involved, and we hope that 
these "assignments" contribute, rather than detract from that experience. 

-----

### "Assignments"

Before we get going, we'd like to clarify some things:
  1. These aren't really assignments. Yes, we ask (*require*) that you do them, but
  they are not intended to be done entirely on your own, nor do you receive a grade.
  When you become an Associate for CrimTech, you will not receive a grade nor will
  you be working entirely on your own. 
  
  Let me reiterate - these are not assignments in the traditional sense, and we ask 
  that you seek as much help as you need, that you collaborate where possible, and that you have some fun with this. 

  2. That being said, these are meant to serve a purpose for you and a purpose for us. 
  *For you*: we want everyone to have something to learn and grow from here.

  ```python
  if you_think_this_is_too_hard:
    talk_to_us()
  elif you_think_this_is_too_easy:
    talk_to_us()
  else:
    rock_on()
  ```

  Yes, that is a contrived example of Python code. Yes it's cheesy. And no, not 
  everything we'll be doing is that easy. More importantly we want you to reach out
  to us (your loving comp directors) at _any_ point. Seriously. You're not bothering us.
  Talking with you, helping you, making this experience great for _you_ is why we do 
  this. Besides, think of it as giving us a valid reason to procrastinate, which we were
  going to do anyway. (For funsies: can you think of criticisms of that contrived 
  "example" above?)

  *For us*: we need to see how well you're doing with understanding how to code for 
  CrimTech. We need to be able to assess how we're doing and how to help you. These 
  projects and assignments are for us to have simple metrics and expose you to code. 

  3. Let me emphasize (again), these are not assignments in the traditional sense. They're meant
  to be kinda fun, kinda educational, kinda challenging. We ask that you not spend more 
  than 5 hours a week comping CrimTech. You have a life (we hope), and even 5 hours a
  week should be excessive, like most of your comp should be coming to the Crimson, 
  coding with [new] friends and getting a break from the intensity of academics. 

  4. Please talk to us....I could've ended the sentence there and it would've been 
  valid. \* cries \* Seriously though, we need your feedback, and it's partially 
  your responsibility to let us know if something isn't working for you.

### Logistics

So you've decided you wanna do this, and trust us, we're freaking *ecstatic* that 
you've done so. We're pumped as we draw this up (maybe too much coffee today?). So 
here's some logistical stuff:

#### Generally:
What you'll need to know coming in:
- How to be civil and respectful
- How to have fun
- How to get work done on time
- How to ask for help so you're not going to bed at 4am every day

What we'll work hard to teach you:
- Python (that's way too broad):
    - More specifically, the Django Framework + Python 2.7
- HTML (it's not always glamorous, but hey it can be cool)
- JavaScript (some call it a microlanguage, some call it a royal pain)
- Git (via Github) - it's tricky and most struggle to use it well at first
  (including yours truly, we sucked at it...for a long time); don't panic!
- Assorted CS practices and concepts (we couldn't think of everything else off
  the top of our heads)

#### Due Dates/Late Policy/The "Fun" Stuff:

*TODOTODOTODOTODO*

#### Submitting:

    Submissions for your assignments will be automatically checked and you'll
    receive feedback immediately. We'll explain the process when we get there,
    and it'll take a little bit to get used to for some of you, but that's ok.
    We're here to help, and you'll master it by the end. 

#### Late Policy: 

    To be honest, we've all been there - you forgot, you had actual homework, you 
    were sick, your goldfish had a funeral, etc. We're human (and students) too. 
    That being said, we require that your projects and assignments be done on time. 
    Checking is automated, so we don't even really get too much of a say. If you're
    even a moment late, don't panic (see Late Policy: sentence 1). Just shoot us an
    email, attaching your assignment. We'll note that it was late, and why. Do this
    immediately upon realizing your asisgnment is late. "But I forgot, so I know it's 
    late, but I can't attach it". Fear not, the mitochondrion is the 
    powerhouseofthecell. Just send us an email the moment you realize it's late, then
    when you've finished it, reply on *that* email thread with the attachment. We're
    not cruel, and we want you to succeed. But you're also not in elementary school,
    and we expect you to be responsible. Reach out to us if you have a problem. Let
    us know if you need something, and we're willing to be accommodating - this is a
    two-way communication highway. 

#### The Hackathon:

  To kick off the comp, we're having a "hackathon." It's *mandatory*, but there'll be 
  pizza and cool people (well, us, but your fellow compers should be pretty cool). 
  You'll get more instructions when you come, but expect to spend some time doing
  lame (awesome) activities, some time coding, and some time chilling. 

  There will be something for everyone (even for you, the comper who is *way* too
  good at CS to be doing "basic" Python exercises). This is not designed as a
  contrived "here's Python, look you can add numbers in it now." It was built
  with the knowledge that you have a skill level that may be different from the person
  next to you. We've been there. We are trying to make you feel like you can work a
  bit, then play a bit. 

  This is a community. 

  If you're super comfortable, help out those around you. If you're super
  uncomfortable, seek out the help of those around you. We'll be there 
  for emotional support (and, ya know, coding help).

#### Midpoints:

  Personally one of our favorite parts of the comp process. It's an interview!
  We won't tell you much about the specifics of it (until you're literally there),
  but expect to dress business formal (no Silicon Valley hoodies), and to answer some
  technical questions. 

  You should see the look on your metaphorical (maybe literal) face. Before you
  panic/get upset/complain, the midpoint interviews are actually intended more as a
  gauge of where you're at. The "technical" questions won't warrant preparation. The 
  other questions will certainly not need too much thought. 

  If you've been actively participating in the comp, midpoints will be an almost 
  literal walk in the park. I'm serious. They're more about your effort than your
  skill - after all, didn't we just finish telling you how we understand you all
  started at different skill levels? *Do. Not. Stress. Out. About. These.*

#### Final Projects:

  These are awesome. They're an introduction
  to some of the team-based structuring of CrimTech in addition to CrimTech's 
  codebase. There will be more details later, but know that these are long-term
  projects that will hopefully be implemented into the Crimson website (your first
  official contribution).

### Wrapping Up

Ok so that was a hella long document to read. And we're sorry, we know your time is
valuable, and we respect that. Thank you for taking the time to read through it. Time
for more contrived Python code:

```python
if comper.question and comper.question in docs:
    return RTFD
elif comper.question and not comper.question in docs:
    return ans
else:
    return None
```

Again, read through that - it's in roughly English, and there are logical redundancies+readibility issues, 
can you see them? Also, sorry (not sorry) for the cheesiness. Seriously though, ask us 
questions - they will save you and us a ton of trouble, and hopefully improve your 
experience. Welcome again, and happy comping! (Proceed to _GET_STARTED.md_ to _get started_)

Love,

Nick \& Richard
